# Topographic-Maps
Generates randomized topographic maps using perlin noise  

This program demonstrates brute force processing throught the use of CPU multithreading.  

The topographic maps generated using this program can be saved as a png image by pressing 'S' and new maps can be generated by pressing 'N'. The user can also press 'Q' to input new generation parameters.
